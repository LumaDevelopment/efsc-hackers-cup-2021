# Programming Problem #2 - Primed
**Filename:** primed.cpp, primed.java, primed.cs, or primed.py

### Description
A "prime" number is an integer greater than 1 with only two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 5, 11 and 23 are prime numbers. Given a positive integer, you are to print a message indicating whether the number is a prime or how close it is to a prime:

### Input

There will be one integer. It will be between 2 and 10,000 (inclusive).

### Output

If the number is a prime, print "Primed!". If the number is not a prime, print "Missed by d" where d shows how close the number is to a prime number (note that the closest prime number may be smaller or larger than the given number). Note that d is always printed as a positive value.

#### Test Case #1
**Sample Input:**
23

**Sample Output:**
Primed!

#### Test Case #2
**Sample Input:**
25

**Sample Output:**
Missed by 2

#### Test Case #3
