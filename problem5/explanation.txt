For this problem, I ran out of time.
By the end I had some code that was starting to work (with some errors), but I did not complete it and forgot to send myself the code to finish it up.
Either way, the method I had gone with was needlessly complicated and if I did post a solution for this problem I likely wouldn't have used my original code as a base.
