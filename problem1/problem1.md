# Programming Problem #1 - Shopping
**Filename:** shop.cpp, shop.java, shop.cs, or shop.py

### Description
Stores will do anything to encourage customers to shop more. A store may charge lower prices if you buy multiples of an item. For example, if you buy one, it may cost you $5 but if you buy two, it may cost you $8 instead of $10.

Let's assume a store provides discounts as follows:

1. No discount if you buy only one.
2. $2 discount for each additional item if you buy more than one.

Given the number of items a customer has purchased and the price for one item, you are to compute the total cost for the customer

### Input

The input consist of two integers. The first integer c (1 <ins><</ins> c <ins><</ins> 100) is the number of items purchased by the customer, and the second integer p (3 <ins><</ins> p <ins><</ins> 50) is the price for one item.

### Output

Output the total cost for the total cost for the customer.
